I want people to be able to add their Username & Token to a class (User). Example:
!login

!Username "My Username"

!Token "My Token"

I'm having problems with getting this to be assigned to the class User. This is important because this is what I'm doing for the GeminiStation project (using SpaceTraders.io as a model for the backend/game API). It can also be used for something like castle.xyz or cometh in Discord, but then I want to build something like a web frontend (maybe in React) that will house the class variables from the discord bot, in Flask. So a flask backend & react frontend.

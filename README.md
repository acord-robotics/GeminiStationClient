[Docs](http://ar.skinetics.tech/stellarios/compass/#geministation) & [Ideas](https://www.notion.so/skinetics/Gemini-Station-15c17fe702ca4e718435a655bdcc0d7c)

My goal for this is as follows:
* Be able to interact with any game's API in Discord/Matrix, the terminal and in a web format
* Explore how this can relate to my team's [Game Engine Project](http://ar.skinetics.tech/stellarios/compass)
* Build some form of NFTs into this platform

Different games and platforms have differing levels of what you can do with their APIs, but I'm wanting to create a way that each game can be interacted with similarly (again, see our Game Engine Project and the [NFT Docs]).

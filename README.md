[Check out the Docs](http://ar.skinetics.tech/stellarios/compass/#geministation) & [Ideas](https://www.notion.so/skinetics/Gemini-Station-15c17fe702ca4e718435a655bdcc0d7c)

# Discord Bot
The bot possesses the following environment variables:
* `discotoken` -> The token for your discord bot (when we publish our bot/client this will be implemented differently)

This repository/replit also possesses some other environment variables:
* `token` -> The user's SpaceTraders.io token
* `discorddeveloperportal` -> A quick link to the admin section for the user's discord bot 

These environment variables are set in the [Repl.it](https://replit.com/@IrisDroidology/GeminiStationClient#README.md) but can also be set in a `.env` file.

# About this Client

My goal for this is as follows:
* Be able to interact with any game's API in Discord/Matrix, the terminal and in a web format
* Explore how this can relate to my team's [Game Engine Project](http://ar.skinetics.tech/stellarios/compass)
* Build some form of NFTs into this platform

Different games and platforms have differing levels of what you can do with their APIs, but I'm wanting to create a way that each game can be interacted with similarly (again, see our Game Engine Project and the [NFT Docs]).
